MyApp is a [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) application built using the [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. The project is designed to demonstrate the usage of SwiftUI combined with MVVM to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
